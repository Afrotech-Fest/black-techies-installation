      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself</p>
        <p class="content__text">I am Erin Burns. I grew in LA, in Inglewood. We moved to the desert when I was eight. There was no one to hang out with except my sister but we didn't share the same interests.
        <p class="content__text"> I was dabbling with photography and when one of our teachers introduced us to computers, my friends and I would dabble with making websites like Geocities or Angelfire, to show my photography.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Before I went to college my parents let me go for the summer to do pre-College, so I could figure out if I wanted to go to art school. So, I did that, really loved it, but realised I couldn’t do it all the time. I finished high school, and then went to the Marymount University to study Business Finance.</p>
        <p class="content__text">After that I was working for the Internal Revenue Service, which is like the HMRC in the US, but still learning to code on my own, using Ruby on Rails and going to meet-ups. After five years I took a few months off and went to Morocco to learn Arabic and French, and I started focusing on learning Ruby.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I went back to New York, worked for the public sector doing audits, and then really want to learn how to code once and for all.  That's when I decided to go to school here and now I am finishing my Masters in Web Design at the University of Greenwich. It was so fast paced but I feel like I learned a lot and still have a lot to learn but it has pushed me to skill up quickly.</p>


        <p class="content__heading">What influenced you to get into tech? How did you get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Initially it was a self-serving reason, I just wanted to show off my pictures when I was a teenager, I didn’t know how to promote myself as an artist (I still don't). When I took a computer class, I learned about websites, that’s the reason why I did them. Now my reasons have an evolved as I've seen that a lot of change can come from tech, my projects tend to be more community focused.</p>
        <p class="content__text">The very first Ruby project that I did was an online marketplace that connects different marketplaces around the world. You could be here in London buying something from a vendor over in Marrakech or I could be in California and buy something from someone in Portobello.</p>
        <p class="content__text">That was the first project that I did and the project that I finished for my Masters is called Extra Curricula.  Kind of a similar concept, it's an online marketplace but it connects the LGBT community and allies to LGBT-friendly vendors, events and services. Definitely more focused on making the world smaller through tech.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Have there been any challenges working in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">One of the challenges is accurately gauging my skill level to a job, to what they want. It's like they want everything and I don't have everything! So it’s getting over that, I don't want to call it imposter syndrome but I guess it's more of a confidence thing.</p>
        <p class="content__text">There are a lot of jobs in tech out there, in web development especially, I think knowing where I can fit is the challenge for me. And also, when you get into a company, you don't know what it’s like until you are there. Researching and finding out what a company is like, I find it really important but it's a little difficult to get that information.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do you overcome those challenges?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I go to a lot of meet-ups, I go to Women Who Code and I met a lot of people through there. Sharing information amongst each other about different companies. I actually know somebody who is really good about networking, like for instance, she got me a diversity scholarship to Things Conference. She’s really good at saying “you need to talk to that person because you're interested in this and they know that”, so I feel like she's a really good resource.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to pursue a career in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I think it is very empowering to know how things work. For me personally, it's like being able to have an idea or solve a problem that could potentially be solved through some kind of skill that I can learn or acquire. Like I said a lot of it is motivated through community type projects. I appreciate face-to-face, and speaking to people and I guess if we can use tech to get people into a room together and talking, which is usually my end goal.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What is your future in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I don't know! I'm going to be so honest with you, I don't know, we'll see. I am going to keep on learning. I think the next thing I am going to learn is Python and continue to build on Extra Curricula and maybe hopefully have a soft launch. I'm really interested in hardware and particularly communications that are not dependent on communication companies, like roll your own internet, Mesh networks and things like that.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What would you advice a young person wanting to get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">It took me a long time to realise that I was interested in tech, if you observe yourself as a young person the things that fascinate you and find an adult that you know and trust ask them <em>"I like this what is it called? Is there a job for this? Or can I get paid for this?"</em></p>

        <p class="content__text">Be aware of the things that you like to spend the most time on or maybe it's connected to other things that are interested in, like mine was photography and websites using my website to promote my photography. Meet other people, go to meet ups, go outside!</p>
