      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself. Where are you from? How did you get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I started as a journalist. I wanted to be a journalist, a writer. I was also very tech-savvy, even from the early days. I became the deputy editor. I started writing for MTV, Dazed and Confused and Time Out. After working with Live I went freelance, to doing a 9 month placement with marketing at Sony Music.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Marketing is tech-focused with big screen advertising a lot of it is digital. I grasped how to use social media and email marketing. I learned about web development and content creation.</p>
        <p class="content__text"> From there I did a degree in Music Journalism, worked as an Artist Manager, then did a Masters in creative writing; I knew I wanted to become a copywriter working for startups doing interesting things.</p>
        <p class="content__text">That was my first major involvement in the tech scene, becoming fully immersed in it, at Campus London (Google Campus), Tech Hub or Silicone Drink About. I'd always be networking as my journalism days had taught me how to network really well, so used that to my advantage.
        <p class="content__text">I spoke to many different founders, built up a great client list independent of any agency. From that I realised that I wanted my own start up, I met a very talented UX designer called Remi Perrichon.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I started to look into what I am passionate about, and what is going to still be relevant in the next ten years. For me publishing, e-books were the potential saviour of publishing.</p>
        <p class="content__text">The music industry, when it was hit by tech, it caused a lot problems and I could see publishing going the same way. Around 2015 I started to build an app called Globe.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Globe is a platform whereby a user can read for free and we intend to integrate digital advertising in a way that is non-obtrusive. I think the difference to when Kindle releases books for free, is the author is not getting paid a penny, they are at the mercy of Kindle/Amazon.</p>
        <p class="content__text">We are trying to cater for the author and the reader which isn't easy by any stretch. It allow the masses to consume books much more and it was less expensive to produce and was affordable.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What have been your challenges and how did you overcome?</p>
        <p class="content__text">It was definitely working in the music industry, as it is that tough. When you transition to the tech industry where everyone is so welcoming, open, and ready to share information, it’s refreshing to say the least.
        <p class="content__text"> The challenge relating to Globe is definitely finding competent and willing talent, especially engineering talent, app and web developers, which is very difficult to do as a bootstrapping founder, until you've got funding.</p>
        <p class="content__text">It's about selling the story, the idea; the big dream to a potential team, I have found that quite challenging. Finding great talent that is reliable, willing and see the vision that you do, that’s one challenge.
        <p class="content__text">Another challenge is that when you are starting out you have very little income; unless you working full time, for me I am lucky enough to be working fulltime as copywriter for another tech company.</p>
        <p class="content__text">In the evenings I am working a solid four hours per day, which can be very challenging especially if it’s back-to-back. You're trying to optimise your life in a way where you can actually get stuff done in an optimal way.</p>
        <p class="content__text">For me, it's thinking how can I organise my calendar in a way that allows me to get the most amount of work done, I found that extremely useful.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I’ve learned that you can't operate at a super high level all the time, and sometimes you're going to need that down time and spending one or two days organising your life and then motivating yourself again.</p>
        <p class="content__text"> If you are working as a solo founder it's really hard to stay motivated. Finding a co-founder can be extremely difficult, luckily very early on I was work with Remi Perrichon.</p>
        <p class="content__text">He was not necessarily a founder, but provided technical support as a developer and donated his time, as he was interested in the idea and to see how far it would go.</p>
        <p class="content__text"> Still I haven’t found a co-founder which is extremely frustrating, but luckily there are places like Founders Forum, founder dating and founder meet-up groups.</p>
        <p class="content__text">When you have a co-founder you can share the weight of the project and you can bounce ideas, when you don't have that it's much easier to just let go. I'd say find a co-founder as early as possible or least someone you can talk to.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to stay?</p>
        <p class="content__text">The culture in tech is super conducive to achievement,  success, to an easier work life balance. Even though people work really hard, they play hard too. I feel that from an early age I was tearing gadgets apart and trying to see how they work for me I have always been very passionate about what technology can do and how it can benefit our lives.
        <p class="content__text">For me, I don't see another field that is as cultural positive in so many aspects as tech is, from the moment you walk into an open workspace or you enter a tech community you find people that are so open and so friendly and want to see you succeed. In tech there are so many different ideas that do not relate to one another so most people are not in competition with one another, and that what fosters a positive community and culture.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What is your future in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">We are about to relaunch Globe as Octo and that's going to take shape over the next few months. I hope that it's going do to big things in terms of the e-reading space, as at the moment it is really dominated by Kindle. I want to start drawing people attention away from the Kindle and e-books and look at alternative platforms where they can form great stories.</p>
        <p class="content__text"> I really see a future where people are more accepting that advertising doesn’t have to be evil, people say a necessary evil but from my perspective it's a necessary good. There's a difference in the type of media that we consume and a lot of it is down to advertising. When advertising is available we are often allowed to access for free.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What advice would you give to young people?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I would say that for young people getting into tech it's very easy to be enamoured with the unicorn stories and to think that your first idea is going to be your last as it's going to be the billion dollar idea. I would say that you need to be slightly reliant on your ability to persevere more than intellect. 99% of the time, if a start up fails it's not usually due lack of determination. It's about seeing the joy in what you are doing as it is really going to help you through those hard times.</p>
