      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself. Where are you from?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Originally, I'm from Rwanda and then we moved to South Africa in 1994. Apparently, because I wanted to become a vet but also because of the genocide, I think it was important to leave. Then we went to South Africa, I was there until I was fourteen and then my parents brought me to the UK around sixteen years ago. I have done many different things, such as, IT, journalism, singing.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How did you get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">It was kind of an accident; I haven't actually studied IT or technology of any kind. It started with helping at my old church Live Church Bradford. I just saw the same guy serving every Sunday and I asked if I could help. He taught me a lot of stuff to do with computers and I've been helping out at church for ten years.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Bloomberg was the first company that hired me for my tech background, the first paid job I ever got, and ever since then I've been fully involved. I was the Global Technical Support, so essentially I would be helping out in French with different customers globally to fix what they needed, mostly software issues. It was hard but good as it was fast paced.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">You mentioned that you didn't study IT, how did you find yourself in a technical role?</p>
        <p class="content__text">It was mostly self-taught and through my church, all the stuff that I learnt having to serve and fix computers that didn't work. Each job has been really helpful with training and learning from people around me.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Could you tell me about your current role and your particular interest in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I was headhunted for a job through a company called NGS. They use particular systems to help get people back into work. It was quite important because I was once unemployed for a year, which was tough. I think being able to help people overcome that is great. I work with different software and I manage about six or seven systems and a colleague and I make sure that the systems don't go down and if they do we make sure we fix them as soon as possible.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Has there been any challenges working the tech industry?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I do know sequence server but maybe not at the level of everybody else so there have been moments where I haven't been as confident in my job. So, I have had to think on my feet and look into it further from what I have been taught. For the past two weeks my colleague has been away, who usually helps me, so it's been really challenging but helpful. I've had to learn deep end stuff and had to figure things out which has been really great for me, a confidence boost to know that I really do know what I am doing.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do you overcome those challenges of working in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I have no shame asking several people for help. That is usually my first port of call: ask somebody how knows better. There's a knowledge base where I work, so I can look up and find out things there. And then other times it's just taking a breath and figuring it out with a process of elimination..</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to stay in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">It is to work my way up so I'm doing more than tech support. I love tech support but I feel like I could do more. It's definitely to fill the gaps within my knowledge and different online courses and evening classes, which could be helpful to build up programming language. To build my way up so in the next five years I'm in a senior position doing what I love and being able to dictate my hours.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do you vision your future in tech?</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Is there a particular area within tech that you would like to explore?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Not at the moment as I don't know enough of what's out there, so I need to continue exploring. I would like to look into coding and building stuff or making cool apps.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What advice would give a young person wanting to get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Probably, study as it's something that I didn't do. I think it will get you miles ahead. But also try not to stay just in the books but find practical ways of exploring tech. What I didn't  know is that lots of companies, like Bloomberg, offer temporary paid internships for six or twelve weeks and you learn stuff that you won't know and you get to see your industry in action. This is really helpful as you can see if you want to do it and helps you determine where you want to go.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Is there anything that you would like to share?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I go to different tech events and hackathons. I know that coworking space Huckletree constantly hosts this stuff for free. KPMG holds similar events too.</p>
