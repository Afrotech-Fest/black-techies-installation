      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself. Where are you from? How did you get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Andy Ayim. I think I've had a really unorthodox introduction into tech. I grew up in Tottenham, in an area called Broadwater Farm. I tell people all the time that my aspirations, in terms of career, were honestly illegal activities because those were the role models that were most close.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I didn't have an uncle that worked in the City and I didn't have an aunt that worked in tech. So, I had no awareness growing up with these kinds of careers. I was a natural sponge and loved continuously learning and always fed my curiosity.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I remember when I was 18 or 19, I said to my parents that I wanted to go backpacking. It occurred to me how momentous that was when I realised that no one in the history of my family, who originated from Ghana, had ever been backpacking.
        <p class="content__text">So I was grateful that my parents allowed me to go. It was one of the best things I have done in my life. Now I realise that there’s life outside of Tottenham, my postcode, the 'ends'. I came back to Tottenham with a very different mind set, much more focused on the long term: wealth, legacy and what I am going to leave for my family..</p>
        <p class="content__text">Another experience that is similar, was when I was younger my Dad was a cabbie and one of his clients was a Nigerian lawyer, a millionaire. She took my brother for work experience and that experience introduced him to a life of wealth, with someone who was a relevant role model as she was black and she was Nigerian. Him sharing his experience exposed us to what's possible.</p>
        <p class="content__text">And similarly I went on work experience with a guy who owned an architects firm, a white guy who lived in Finchley, middle-class, who had a Fiesta but he was very wealthy. It showed me it's not about wearing designer clothes or wearing wealth outside of you.</p>

        <p class="content__text"> And he'd take on projects where I'd go to a house he's building for a multi-millionaire and I'd never seen that type of wealth before. I realised that I didn't study until university to get a job, then a pension and then just die. There’s more to life.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I stumbled into tech because there was a pain point close to my heart that I wanted to solve and I had a few friends that were interested. We were really big fans of UK Grime and Hip Hop music, to find this type of music was quite difficult, you would have to either record pirate radio stations or go to forums online, MySpace or an artist website.</p>
        <p class="content__text">There was no central location online to discover and stream this music, so we created a website called Mixtape Madness. It was a software enabled business and I was an non-technical founder, I couldn't write a line of code. But what that means is that I had to learn quickly: how do you build something that your users and customers want?</p>
        <p class="content__text">That company served about over half billion streams online, working with the likes of Spotify and Choice FM. We have over 250,000 registered users, and the YouTube channel alone has about 200,000. It showed we were solving a problem.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What have been the challenges of working in tech and how have you overcome them?</p>
        <p class="content__text">One of the things that I have mentioned, being a non-technical founder you’re a little bit in the dark. I had to gain experience working with software developers. My current role within tech, is a Product Manager for a FinTech company (financial technology), a very fast growth company and exposed me to developers day in and day out.</p>
          <p class="content__text">Sometimes you have to take a step back and gain the necessary experience and skills set before you go on to that next job or that next venture. A lot of the non-technical founders that I've know along the years have failed to build something really meaningful, as they've had a business where tech is at the core but lacked the technical skills to build it.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I think some people battle with this because really they think they hate work, they want to be their own boss, and they should start a business, when actually the thought pattern should be, "I hate work, I might need a new job, and I might need to start a business". There's a range of different options, you shouldn't jumped to “I need to start a business”, as it's actually the most difficult route and probably the lowest probability of you succeeding.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to stay in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Outside of my 9-5, I write a lot and speak a lot at conferences about the lack of diversity in tech. There was a stat that got my blood flowing,I knew this is the problem that I'm dedicated to solving: less than 1% of venture capital start-ups are black owned. You are depriving a market from diversity of thought. A lot of people think that a black founder creates a solution that solves a problem for just a black audience, which is not true.</p>
        <p class="content__text">There are a few things that I do, one is supporting non-technical founders, and the truth is a lot people from our community weren’t in coding clubs from a young age like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, they didn’t have exposure to these things so they're only learning it later in life. So, how do we help these people have a fair shot?</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What advice would give a young person in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">One of the most important things is to feed your curiosity. For me, it meant travelling and later going to tech events. What does it look like for you? Abstract that from a job or starting a business. Just think about the things that you stay passionate about, or the skills that you say you are good at, and think about what you can do to further develop those interests.</p>
        <p class ="content__text">Because, ultimately, you want to get to place where you are passionate about a certain thing, you have a specific skill set that you are developing and you actually see a market need. Really think,  if I go on that continuous learning journey, what is that thing that I am willing to dedicate my life to relearning again and again. Sometimes you get clues: what type of content are you absorbing on all you social platforms and they should give you a clue to what you are naturally interested in.</p>
