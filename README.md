# Black Techies Project
## An interactive photography and interview project highlighting the experiencs of Black techies in the UK

The Black Techies is an interactive photography and interview project that focuses exclusively on black people in tech, in all their varied identities, but also as a specifically underrepresented group in technical roles within the industry. It presents an opportunity for a variety of conversations - on one side, the importance of representation, that you ‘Can’t be what you can’t see’ whilst on the flip side, black techies who might be isolated in their places of work, or their careers can see others like themselves. The Black Techies Project was inspired by Helena Price's Techies Project.

**Credits**: The project was commissioned by Afrotech Fest and delivered by Hayley Reid, a film-maker and oral historian, and Roxene Anderson, a photographer.
