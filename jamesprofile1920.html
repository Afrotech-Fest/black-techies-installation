      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself, where you are from and how you got into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">My name is James Ojo. I have been working in the tech space for the past year and my journey started learning to binary code in Nigeria. Then I ended up studying a degree which combined C++ programming. In the corporate world I transitioned to being a business analyst and then landed a business analyst/product management role, which forced me to be more data led, look at the decisions we make and help customers get value and businesses to achieve their goals.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What is you current role and how did you get there?</p>
        <p class="content__text">That's kind of a funny one, as I transitioned into working in a B2B SAS product and that came about through a founder who saw some of the work that I've been doing and he asked me to be the first person to really own the product. So I jumped at the chance and I sought out people I knew who were already doing that role to guide me.<p>
        <p class="content__text">To make sure that I wasn't making the same mistakes that a lot of people would have made and to have people to bounce ideas with. I totally immersed myself in the space, spending 20+ hours weekly building my domain consuming it through articles, videos and podcasts. Also, continuously executing and validating my ideas with people within that space and those that have had skin in the game. Just working and implementing small projects built up my muscle within my domain and improve skills.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Have you had any challenges working in tech? If so, how have you gone about dealing with those challenges?</p>
        <p class="content__text">The key challenge that I've observed working in tech, a lot of the fastest growing and the most valuable companies have been engineering led. I've also seen engineers, who I think are the key architects of delivery, they’re in a world where everyone is telling them how to do their job. I think for me it made me want to understand more about the role. So I made it my objective to really understand what they do, so I'm able to communicate with them, know how to work together.  To be able to deliver value to users, and understand what that means from a design perspective as well as understanding what people want.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to stay in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">For me it is not difficult as I've always used technology, I've always been curious about the parts of it that I feel like I can add the most value to. I remember growing up playing with a computer and breaking it; I'm sure my parents would say that I broke about three computers. That was me trying to figure out how to do things. Thinking about a larger shift, I think technology has become a big enabler for a lot of the things we use today.</p>
        <p class="content__text">The more I develop my understanding and experience of the time that we are in, the more understand how it has enabled companies and organisations to have control over the end to end experience and to be able to manage and ensure that people are getting the best experience in terms of how their interactions are and to be able to iterate on what they are seeing in the data so they can be able to deliver that value in real time. </p>

        <p class="content__heading">How to you see your future in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I see myself increasing people from diverse backgrounds being able to implement a hypothesis driven process that is based more on a combination of what data in telling them as well as our understanding of what the people that we are trying to deliver want. That is something I'm very equipped to do as I have good understanding of data and I can work the intersections of what technology enables us to do.</p>
        <p class="content__text">My understanding of the user experience and at the same time how to build scalable and repeatable business models that helps us build products that can serve users better than anyone else on the market. I think that is something when you are thinking about high growth products that are technology enabled, these are the key things that need to work really well as well as other things such as culture and funding.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What would you advise a young person wanting to get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">If you’re a young person wanting to get into tech, I think you should just feed your curiosity and learn how to do little bits of code, it help you understand the world that you're about to step in to and understand the different parts of the puzzle. I can certainly say that my experience has influenced that.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Something simple like understanding what HTML can do or if you like working with Python looking at the user experience. If you have that feeling like tech might be for you then there’s a number of people and there’s a number of things you can do to really explore that. We're starting to get a lot of visibility and that is inspiring and it inspires me.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Is there anything else that you would like to share?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I forced myself to start writing and sharing my experiences on Medium and that helps me to really clarify what I'm thinking.</p>
        <p class="content__text">We're starting to build up an ecosystem where we are going to see products that are designed to be inclusive of us but that's going to leverage the ideas that we create.</p>
