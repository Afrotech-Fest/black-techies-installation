      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself. Where are you from?</p>
        <p class="content__text">My name is Olu, I am from Luton. Originally from Nigeria. I currently work for BT as a front end developer, so a lot of JavaScript for me, I love JavaScript. I am working on the Afrotech Fest with a group of other people.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How did you get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">When I was younger I went on a website called Neopets and you could make a page. They try and trick you by doing your first HTML through that, you think that are playing but you are actually learning. I guess that was the first time I coded. Many years later, I went to university and there I started coding using Code Academy and I went to their boot camp.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I studied Philosophy, which is unrelated to tech. I had an interest in tech when I was young; I was the one who installed the dial up modem on my family computer when I was in primary school. I always loved computers but never thought to actually do it.</p>
        <p class="content__text">But when Code Academy came out, a friend that I lived with, said I should check it out as I was into tech. It put a seed in my mind. I wanted to be a journalist and decided not to do that, I wanted to work for a charity and decided not to do that. And the after that I decided to work in tech as I've been doing this for a long time.

        <p class="content__heading">Have there been any challenges working in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Yes, especially coming from boot camp it's difficult because you feel like you haven't learned enough and no one is going to take you seriously. Also, being a non-binary person and black in tech has often been a challenge, there's so many microaggresions. It often quite difficult to be happy and excited in what I am doing, as people are just annoying.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to stay in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I just love computers; they have so much potential to change the world. I think it's important for black people and non-binary people to take means of production as they are now and make something with them rather than always consuming. It isn't our fault but it's annoying when it's always white people and men who are controlling what gets made in these really important technologies.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What is the future of tech? Or what is your future in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">In general, I guess automation is going to more of a thing as well as AI, more of robots controlling things. I would like to start my own projects; I've been trying to start Wild Card, which is a group for people using JavaScript, for a while. I've been nervous, so I think making a business would be an even bigger jump. I would like to start a boot camp for people that are underprivileged in tech, as our boot camp started out that way but it has changed as it has gone on.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What advice would you give a young person getting into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Don't be scared to get on Twitter and other platforms to ask questions. People are not going to be as annoying as you think if you seem interested. If you want to go into coding, and other bits of tech, make sure you have tried it out by yourself first of all, online.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Try and build stuff, even small stuff like HTML pages, and see how you feel about it before you start spending money. It's impossible to get into tech with spending any money at all, so you should try as hard as you can before you resort to going to a boot camp because it's a lot of money.</p>
