      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me about yourself</p>
        <p class="content__text">I am LiLi Kathleen Bright. I work at a Product Engineering company, an agency called Navoda. I am a Scrum-Master, which means that I work with a team of Software Engineers, Quality Assurance Testers and Business Analysts. I help them think about their ways of working and communication.
        <p class="content__text"> And I'm from south London. I taught myself how to write HTML when I was a teenager. I was intrigued about websites and how they worked. Then, I did A-Level Computer Science, which I really enjoyed. The digital part of it was stuff that I had already learnt on my own or with websites.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I hadn't planned to go into tech. I did a degree in religion, philosophy and ethics. After, I did an internship in a non-for-profit as an IT Assistant for three months. I worked as a web developer for various organisations.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I have gone on a journey, playing with things that I’m interested in, and as my interests change, learning different things. I took a break for a couple of years to volunteer at a volunteer-run vegan cooperative cafe, and then at another cafe. I came back to tech as a project manager, then a product owner, and now a scrum-master.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Do you find time to explore, like you did initially when you got interested in tech and experiment outside of your job role?</p>
        <p class="content__text">My experience has been that's been necessary. One of the reasons I left tech before was I was not interested in some parts of that, and needed to do that to do my job. So, I was like: "I'm going to have a break!" But I still enjoy HTML and CSS, even though I don't do that in my job.</p>

        <p class="content__text">I've got my own Wordpress site, and I'm really interested in team dynamics, communication, facilitation and organisation culture. I spend time outside work exploring those things, going to events and reading articles. I give talks at work and I want to give talks outside of work.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What are you talks on?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I gave a talk at work about 'burnout', wellbeing and energy levels, inspired by an event I went to. I did another about non-binary gender and pronouns. I am working on one about organisational culture and working towards creating one that supports and encourages collaborative working.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What are the challenges of working in tech, and the workshops and the talks that you are doing in response to some of those challenges?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Yeah, definitely. I mean with 'burnout' for example that I have experienced in relation to work, to non-paid work, activism and other stuff. It's something that there's not much awareness of. It's been really helpful to give a talk about that because it helped learn and understand more myself. I want to do more around mental health because it's not talked about that much and I feel like people would be more prepared, easier to identify mental health issues, much better able to support other people as well.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What keeps you motivated? What do you love about tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text"> I'm a geek. I really enjoy HTML, figuring out how things work, writing stuff that creates something. I find it a little bit hard to describe but just really enjoy it; I really love learning and really like variety. I feel really lucky that I'm so interested in something that I can do as a job as well. And that it's developing so fast. I find sitting down at a computer and looking at my website and being like <em>"I want to create this thing, let's play around with this"</em> and hours go by and I'm like <em>"OK I didn't realise that I've spent this much time doing this thing."</em></p>

        <p class="content__heading">Does your current role enable to do the things that you want to within tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Yes and no. In London there's so many events. Especially at Navoda, staff have budgets for training and conferences. There's so much free stuff, loads of meet-ups about Agile (a way of working). Makes it easy to find out about things, to meet people and make connections. At the same time, the tech industry is white male dominated, you’re making connections but only with some parts of society.</p>
        <p class="content__text">That manifesto that a Google employee wrote, there was a lot of conversation about misogyny, gender and gender roles and sometimes it can be difficult to deal with those issues. Even when you’re somewhere that you get on well with everybody, that workplace is reflective of the broader tech industry: mostly white men.

        <p class="content__text"> I work somewhere that is awesome, but there's still those challenges. I think I've only met one other black scum-master, so most of the people that I meet don't face things that I face. But I've got of links outside the industry, friends who are black and are in tech. I feel really lucky to have that, that’s not something I always had, it's fairly new.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do see your future in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">At the moment, I am focusing on becoming a better scrum-master, and learning as much as I can in my day-to-day job also outside of the that. I am also interested in learning and education generally, supporting people coming into tech. Helping other people, specifically coming into tech and focusing on organisation culture and creating places and ways of working that are supportive, humane and fun to work in.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What would you advise a young person wanting to get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Just try out things that you are interested in, learning stuff, making connections with people, and going to events. If there aren't events in your area, find people online, like forums and Slack. Talk to people, if there are specific roles that you are interested in, talk to people who are in those roles. Or if you don’t know what kind of role, just talk to lots of people in different areas. Keep experimenting and exploring and don't worry if you feel like you don't have skills or enough skills.</p>
