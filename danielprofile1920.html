      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Please can you introduce yourself?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I'm Daniel, I'm a front end developer. I currently work for Shortlist Media and I'm also the Lead Tutor for Black Girl Tech, which creates safe spaces for black women to learn about tech and coding.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How did you get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I kind of fell into tech. I tried everything literally, I worked at bar, Smithfield meat market, retail, everything basically. I started an IT course and from there got a position in IT support. Experiencing that corporate life was underwhelming for me,<em>"ah this it, this is what people strive for?"</em>. I'm quite compulsive so I just quit and decided to go travelling, <em>“find myself”.</em></p>
        <p class="content__text"> Nearly found myself broke but you know you carry on. When I got back from travelling I decided to look at coding as a way of reconnecting with the things I was doing back in college. I did Interactive Media and we did one module on coding, which was so far back  the only code I remembered was basic HTML.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I started on Code Academy, teaching myself in my own time. Then I happened on an internship, so I just went for it and they decided to take me and I then secured a permanent role within the company. From there I've been learning from each job that I have taken.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">You studied interactive media at college. Is there an overlap with the coding you did then and what you are doing now?</p>
        <p class="content__text">With Interactive Media we did a whole bunch of stuff, photography, video editing, illustration, everything. There was a ‘make a website’ module and we kind of touched on everything. Before then, I didn't have any experience with code. I was already a huge tech head in terms of my PC and gaming, but never got into software, or how to make websites.</p>
        <p class="content__text">It did not really pique my interest. I was introduced to a lot of different disciplines within the interactive space and this happened to be the one that I came back to.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Have there been any challenges working with tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I think the biggest thing is that you have to keep learning. You can't rest on your laurels, because you've secured a job. Part of your job as a developer is to keep learning because things are changing all the time you really have to keep up to date and be comfortable with self-study. It's really about putting the time in.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I was pretty lucky; it was an internship so the pressure was off. That's one of the things that hit me, being in IT support where you're comfortable, the  job doesn’t change from day-to-day. Tech is a different landscape - you really have to stay on top of stuff.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How did you make the decision to find new skills outside of you day job? You mentioned Black Girl Tech, are there any other things that you do outside your day job?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I knew the founder of Black Girl Tech (BGT) before she started it. I started out as a volunteer helping out the students and it took me a while to get to that point because, when I first started out in tech there was a confidence issue. I felt like I didn’t quite know enough or I wasn’t at the level that I should have been.</p>
        <p class="content__text"> It took me a while to take the leap, that I do have stuff that is valuable to other people. When I put myself in that space I realised these skills that I take for granted can help people. The Afrotech Fest site, a year ago, I probably wouldn’t have done as I lacked confidence in my skills. Within the last year I have gained a lot of confidence and I have been able to make moves and really get involved with more community stuff and be more visible in those spaces.</p>

       <p class="content__heading">What motivates you to stay in tech?</p>
       <p class="content__text">I think it's the learning, as I mentioned earlier. If I stop learning in a role, I'll leave and find something else. It's about me always trying to push myself to become better. I kind of need that constant feeling of operating at a level just above my comfort zone. In tech you can get that in abundance, for better or worse. It can lead to things like burn out, but I try and adopt a healthy work life balance.</p>

       <p class="content__text">Certainly, the feeling that I can just build something. if I can think it, I can build it - that's very empowering.</p>

       <p class="content__heading">What advice would you give a young person entering into tech?</p>
       <p class="content__text">I'd say don't focus on what you don't know, focus on the goal you are trying to accomplish and make those small and attainable. So, maybe you decide you want to build an app. Forget about completing it or making money from it, just focus on the task at hand and then, when you feel like you need to move onto something else, don't feel bad, move on.
       <p class="content__text">The more you do this, the more you learn - you won't even realise you're learning - and the more it will come together. In terms of getting a role, talk to people already in tech, ask about their day-to-day, about the skills that they exhibit on a day-to-day basis and try and replicate that.</p>
       <p class="content__text">That would help getting your first role, if you're already aware of what is expected of you. You don’t need to know everything technically, as that will come with time and experience. Just going out there and finding a community you learn these things by default. Just trust the process and that should be it.</p>

       <p class="content__text">Always try and understand the code that you're writing and if you can't figure it out for yourself ask someone to explain it to you, whether it’s online or at meet-ups. The key to understanding things is not to know everything.
       <p class="content__text">When there's an opportunity to learn don’t pass it up, you that opportunity to try to get to the bottom of what you are trying to figure out. I think the more you repeat that, the easier your time in tech will be.</p>
