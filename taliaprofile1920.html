      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself</p>
        <p class="content__text">I'm Tailia, I'm 24 years, and I’ve been in technology for 3 or 4 years now. I initially started when I went to uni, I studied Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What have been the challenges working in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Straight after uni I went into contracting, so I have worked in a range of different companies. I worked as a contractor in places where I'm the only black person and female, those are two challenges working in a white male dominated industry. At the same time it has been very rewarding, as I am fulfilling my passion of working in technology.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about your current role?</p>
        <p class="content__text">When I first started, I worked in IT support. Service desk analyst, first line and second line support. With my degree I gained a Prince2 qualification, which enabled me to go into project management. I continued my independent studies and paid to do an ITIL qualification, which helped me get into service management. Right now, I manage the incidents that we get through our clients. So, if I'm working for a Manage Service Provider, and they have an issue with their IT system I would be the intermediary between the supplier and the company. I use software such as XLs, VVA, Macros, Tableaux, and PalBI.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do you overcome the challenges?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I went to uni at aged 18 and graduated at 21. During the summer break, I worked, and I don't know if it was because of my age or I was a bit naive, the first two jobs that I had I got fired. I thought they were trying to provoke this ‘angry black woman’ stereotype. When I started, I was asked where I grew up and when I confirmed that it was Peckham, I was asked if I knew Giggs (Grime Artist) and silly things like that.</p>
        <p class="content__text">Another similar incident was a young black person murdered in south London and people assumed that I knew him and was sharing their condolences. Being black you always have to work on perception. It's been challenging during the probation period when starting a new job, and whenever I am working well nothing is said.</p>
        <p class="content__text">There is no encouragement, but as soon as I do something wrong the senior management would get involved. I had people say that I look bored or I look like I have an attitude. I don't know what it is I just feel like I am always being monitored. I feel the pressure to try and break the stereotypes. I think as a contractor working in different companies, it has worked out well and I have learned how to play the game and adapt to different environments.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What motivates you?</p>
        <p class="content__text">What initially fuelled my fire for the love of technology was as a child I wanted to be an astronaut. I love everything to so with technology, I am always in the loop.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do you see your future in tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I don't know if this is right to say but I want to be the Kim Kardashian of tech. You see me and I'm not the stereotypical person that would be into tech. Going forward I would like to be a spokesperson encouraging young black women to get into technology. Hopefully one day start my own business.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What you advise a young person wanting to get into tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">Know how to play the game and work on your perception. Create a good impression, as being a black person, it isn't easy. Work hard and fulfil your hunger to learn.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How do engage with tech outside of your day job?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I recently started a YouTube channel called Tailia Sky, an introduction to me being a black girl in technology, and how I fell in love with technology. I’ve talked about what I studied at university and what is the future of technology. My latest video is called Humanoids, talking about AI and the concept of creating robots to resemble humans and questioning the ethics around it. I sometimes showcase what I've built through coding.
        <p class="content__text">On the side, I do a bit of web design using HTML. I also, speak at college events trying to engage more young people into tech particularly with BAME communities.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">How are you using your skills learned at uni?</p>
        <p class="content__text">When I finished the course I got job offers in coding, as Junior Web Developer and a Junior SQL Developer, but I felt like I didn't fit into those environments, it was a bit isolating. I preferred service management within IT, as I like working with clients instead making things.</p>
