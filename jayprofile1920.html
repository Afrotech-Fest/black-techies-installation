      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="content__heading">Tell me a bit about yourself. Where are you from?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I am Jay Bernard, from London. I would describe myself as a writer, film programmer, archivist and my work lives in the intersections of queerness, race, history, technology and the archive. I have a literature background, a writer since I was a teenager but have become interested in technology. I'm one year from becoming a digital native, as it's '89 onwards; I grew up with technology. I've never come at it from a technical perspective, but how it impacts culture.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Could you talk about your current project relating to tech? How did you get interested in tech to explore in your work?</p>
        <p class="content__text">The areas I am the most interested at the moment is Virtual Reality (VR), and using tech to tell stories and explore queerness, race and bodies. I've just finished a project, about Alan Turing's trial. I wrote one of the pieces, a VR, 360 film piece. It was a completely different way of telling that story, exploring history. I am working with the National Theatre, to develop a set of stories about the areas of queerness that do not get talked about.</p>
        <p class="content__text">For that I'm using Tilt Brush, the 3D drawing software. You need quite an intense machine to run it but it's simpler to design a complete immersive environment using this programme than it is do it on paper or try and use weird software. Actually when I'm in it, when I’m telling a story, I have to be thinking about every degree that a person could be engaging with. This is a really different way of thinking about telling a queer narrative.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Have there been any challenges working with this particularly tech or combining the tech with your art practice?</p>
        <p class="content__text">The technology is new, it's hard to get this stuff out there. You make a video and bang it on YouTube, but with VR you need an app, get a headset, and then work out how to fit your phone in; it's so many steps. I think that technical barrier will break down; I think a headset is going to be like a laptop in 5 or 10 years.</p>
        <p class="content__text">And as it's visual, someone who is visually impaired is automatically barred from this experience. I think that is a big question about VR, the sensory side. We have thought about using the haptic stuff, trying to incorporate arms and all of that.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I’m writing about having a queer, black body, a body that is attached to the phone or other tech. What it means for borders, identity, surveillance. It's the direction that my work should go it but it's limited at the moment.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What has motivated/inspired you to explore technology in this way?</p>
        <p class="content__text">It's so exciting! I grew up on the Internet, got access when I was 11/12. I actually think that it ruined my life a bit; before that I was extremely bookish, had not the internet arrived I would have read a lot more, written more, approached the world differently.</p>
        <p class="content__text">But I benefited hugely from the queer material that I was able to access. Even though I have no attention span anymore, I think I have managed to develop this interesting queerness. A lot of queer politics, trans politics, the speed and the complexity of it, has come about due to the ease of the internet.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I used to have pen pals, then with Web 2.0, I directly engage, be what I want. That was a big thing for me, I went on the internet and I was male. My instinct was to have this male identity, to be queer online.</p>

        <p class="content__text">And now, we've got the Internet of Things on the horizon and VR. I have to document a) the early Internet from a black British perspective b) some questions that have developed over the last 15 years, in terms of how queerness has developed. I am seeing the same old pattern of tech and all of the marginal people and their stories are not being told.</p>


        <p class="content__heading">I am quite curious what you said about archiving yourself on the Internet - how would you do this?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I think it's important to write about my experience on the early internet because that's lost. Back then people weren’t recording things in the way they are now. I think it is important to remember and even if the memory isn’t perfect, to have some of documentation of that. Part of me is like “this might be a special moment that could be destroyed in the next 5 or 10 years” it has happened before.</p>
        <p class="content__text">I know I want to create more 360 films and VR experiences but my other interest is the past; I've written about the New Cross Fire. For me it's like the past and the present, the past and the future intertwined, in a way the aesthetic of Afrofuturism, this bizarre circularity.</p>
        <p class="content__text">What is it about being human that is always relevant? Tech companies are asking themselves, if robots can do everything what are we going to do with humans? People talk about Universal Basic Income, as an artist, I need to eat and keep on engaging with the world. What environment am I going to be creating for myself? When I was using Tilt Brush, I can design my own world, so why am I replicating dystopias. I think it is imperative for artists and people who are interested to get on board.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">What would you advise a young person that want to get into tech, with specific interests in the intersections between art and tech?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I don't think I could advise a young person, if anything I would need the advice from a young person! If it's a question like how do develop a practice, it's the same answer it’s always been, just put enough time and effort into it. One of the down sides of this hyper-connected world is if your project is about reflection and rethinking the world, you've really got to turn that off for a while.</p>

        <p class="content__heading">Anything else you would like to share?</p>
        <p class="content__text">I am a programmer at BFI Flare. I'm always on the lookout for interesting things with tech. Please just try and make some immersive work coming from this queer perspective, an black intersectional politicised perspective because I've seen enough charity NGO videos about starving Africans.</p>
